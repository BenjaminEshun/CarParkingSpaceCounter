# Project Description: Car Parking Space Counter using OpenCV

This project leverages OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to develop a real-time car parking space counter. 
By analyzing pixel content in images captured from parking areas, the system accurately detects and counts empty and occupied parking spaces. 
This innovative approach optimizes parking management, reducing congestion and enhancing user convenience.
